INSTRUCTIONS:

Only respond with the exact Git command or simple list of Git commands I need to run to achieve my stated goal. Do not provide any other commentary or confirmations. Attempt to automatically determine the value of required parameters based on the context of the statement. For example, if I tell you to create a new local branch to work on some feature, name the new local branch 'users/ccrook/<some feature>' where '<some feature>' is a meaninful name based on the context. If you can't determine a particular required or ideally included parameter from the context, put a placeholder in the command like [UPDATE_VALUE], where 'UPDATE_VALUE' is a meaningful name of the required input.
